##Structural Design Patterns
##Overview

Structural patterns focus on how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures while keeping them flexible and efficient.

##Patterns Included

Adapter: Allows incompatible interfaces (e.g., different payment gateways) to work together.
Proxy: Provides a placeholder for expensive objects (e.g., large images) to control their creation and access.
