# Iterator Pattern - Channel Collection Example

**Problem**  
When working with collections (like lists of channels), exposing the underlying structure to the client makes the code dependent on the collectionâ€™s implementation. The client has to manage indexing and traversal, which reduces flexibility and breaks encapsulation.  

**Solution**  
I applied the Iterator Pattern:  

- Created a `ChannelIterator` interface with `hasNext()` and `next()` methods.  
- Implemented `ChannelIteratorImpl` to traverse the collection internally.  
- Built a `ChannelCollection` class to store channels and provide an iterator.  
- The client (`Main`) uses the iterator to loop through channels without knowing how they are stored.
