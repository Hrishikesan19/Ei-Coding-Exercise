## Behavioral Design Patterns

## Overview
Behavioral design patterns focus on how objects **communicate and interact** with each other. They define clear responsibilities and improve flexibility in assigning behavior to objects.

## Patterns Included
Iterator: Provides a way to access elements of a collection sequentially without exposing its internal structure (e.g., iterating through TV channels).  
Observer: Defines a one-to-many dependency so when one object changes state, all dependents are notified automatically (e.g., stock notifying traders).
