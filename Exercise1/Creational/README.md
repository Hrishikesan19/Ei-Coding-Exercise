## Creational Design Patterns
## Overview
Creational design patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

## Patterns Included
Singleton: Ensures only one instance of a class (e.g., Logger, ConfigManager) exists across the application.  
Factory: Creates objects without exposing the instantiation logic (e.g., SMS, WhatsApp, Email notifications).
